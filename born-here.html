Palestinian rap group DAM (Da Arab MC's) created this music 
video about the life of Palestinians in Israel.  They're from 
Lod, a town between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, so they're 
Palestinians with Israeli citizenship (sometimes called 
"Israeli Arabs").  They usually rap in Arabic, but they made 
a Hebrew version of this song with a music video to get 
their message out to the majority of Israelis who don't speak Arabic.

I've always wanted a subtitled version, so I broke down and adapted the lyrics from their website to create this.  I think this is one of the most powerful rap songs out there.

<h2>The Chorus</h2>
<p>
A comment asked what the (Arabic) lyrics of the chorus mean.  I 
think the chorus is really beautiful and evocative, so here's 
my personal interpretation of what they're saying.  It's much too 
long for the comments, so I put it here...
</p><p>
<b>"Our neighborhood is embarassed, not dressed in silk,<br>
if fear lives in our hearts<br>
A bride without a veil, waiting, longing..."</b>
</p><p>
The context here is that all the land that was in the British 
mandate of Palestine is one of the most beautiful places on 
Earth:  temperate climate, fertile, and full of history.  Palestinians 
love their country and land.  The remaining Palestinian places in 
Israel (those not destroyed by Jewish paramilitaries in '48) 
deserve to show their beauty, to be "dressed in silk".  However, 
they're held back, on the one hand by Israeli policy that taxes 
Palestinian citizens equally, but does not deliver public services 
equally and even
actively oppresses Palestinian citizens of Israel in other 
ways.  On the other hand, they're also held back by the fear 
they carry in their own hearts.  That fear is the result of 
their difficult history, but it's also an internal obstacle they 
have to overcome in order to reclaim their inalienable rights.  One 
could draw a parallel to the US civil rights movement.
</p><p>
<b>"Ethnic cleansing knocks on the door"</b>
</p><p>
This is a direct reference to various right-wing Israeli 
politicians who openly call for the "transfer" (that is, 
ethnic cleansing) of Palestinians, both from the West Bank 
and Gaza, but sometimes also from within the internationally 
recognized borders of Israel.  Remember that DAM comes from 
a Palestinian town that's within that "green line" border.
</p><p>
<b>"Time's passed over her, forgotten her, <br>
the seperation wall mutes her hope"</b>
</p><p>
Palestinian towns in Israel have languished and remained undeveloped 
relative to other places (for the reasons described above).  Israel's 
seperation wall further tears away the fabric of Palestinian life 
within Israel, by cutting off Palestinian Israelis from their 
countrymen in the West Bank and Gaza, thus the wall mutes 
"her" hope ("she" being the human spirit and life of the Palestinian 
cities, towns and villages within Israel).
</p><p>
<b>"Like a bird that breaks out of the cage, <br>
she'll spread her wings and fly...</br>
NO FEAR"</b>
</p><p>
But the Human spirit is is a powerful thing.  Aspects of Israeli policy, 
both official an unofficial, have been trying to wipe out Palestinian 
identity and culture, and even displace the maximum number of Palestinian 
people.  But it's not working&nbsp;- even after 60 years of 
oppression and occupation, the spirit of Palestine lives on.  Thus, 
Palestinian national identity and the human reality of Palestinians 
is like a bird, that one day will "spread her wings and fly"...  As 
long as Palestinians, individually and collectively, do not let 
themselves be ruled by the fear that others have tried to instill 
in their hearts.
